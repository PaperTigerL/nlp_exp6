    "You can input a query or a question. The script then uses semantic search\n",
    "to find relevant passages in Simple English Wikipedia (as it is smaller and fits better in RAM).\n",

    "For semantic search, we use `multi-qa-distilbert-cos-v1` model and retrieve\n",

    "Next, we use a more powerful CrossEncoder (`qnli-distilroberta-base` model) that\n",
    "scores the query and all retrieved passages for their relevancy. The cross-encoder further boost the performance,\n",
    "especially when you search over a corpus for which the bi-encoder was not trained for.\n"
